# Sega Saturn Crontroller input demux to discrete outputs.

This is an Arduino sketch for demultiplexing Saturn controller inputs to discrete outputs. I desinged it for Arcade Supergun use but it could be adapted for use in many other control applications that require discrete outputs.

# Instructions

The upload the .ino file to an Arduino Uno or similar compatible device and connect the I/O pins according to the layout described in the .ino file. If you wish to remap the buttons you can modify the pin selections int the file to suit your needs.
